# Python3 program to variants of Binary Search
 

# l means left index, r means right index, m means middle index

# Comments
# I have seen many different styles of binary search solution, I saw some people tend to use some pattern whenever solving binary search problems, i.e.

# while(l <= r){...}. Same while condition
# r = m - 1;, right is always m - 1
# l = m + 1: , left is always m + 1
# It is a good idea to use pattern/template for binary search?
# I can only speak for myself. At least for me, I do not think so. I prefer to choose the binary search rules based on the context of the problem to decide how to play with l and r.
# If you are using pattern, you have to remember it. You are not understanding the core of binary search! This is a big issue I think.

# Algorithms
# I want to give my explanation below:

# First of all, we assume [l, r] is the possible answer range(inclusive) for this question. So initially l = 0; and r = n - 1;

# we calculate int m = l + (r - l)/2; rather than int m = (l + r)/2; to avoid overflow.

# Clearly, if A[m] = target, m is exactly the position we should insert the target

# if A[m] < target, then the insertion position should be at least at m + 1, because it can be even larger, i.e. to the right of m + 1(including m + 1), we set l = m + 1;

# if A[m] > target, the insertion position should be at most m, because it can even smaller. So we would set r = m. An example:

# target: 6 and m = 7
# 1 	5 	7 	9
# 	    m
# 	  result
# Then how to determine the while loop condition, l < r, l <= r or l < r - 1?
# The answer is that we analyse and conclude with the one which will not cause deal while loop in our code while we are moving our left and right pointers.

# l = m + 1
# r = m
# We will analyse which would happen when we have 3, 2 and 1 elements at the end below

# First let's assume there are 3 elements left at last as shown below:

# x   x   x   5 	7 	9   x   x   x
#             l	m   r
# we can see that l = m + 1 can help shrink the search space by 2:

# x   x   x   5 	7 	9  x   x   x
#             l	m   r
# and r = m can help shrink the size by 1:

# x   x   x   5 	7 	9   x   x   x
#             l	r
# so 3 elements will not cause dead while loop. we should be fine.

# Next we reduce to 2 elements:

# x   x   x   5   7   x   x   x
#            l/m  r
# Same way, we can see that l = m + 1 and r = m can both shrink the size by 1, no dead loop as well.

# Then we can safely go to the cases when we have only 1 element at the end:

# x   x   x   5   x   x   x
#             l/m/r
# We can see that l = m + 1 will not cause dead loop, but with r = m we cannot shrink the size anymore, so it might lead to a dead while loop. So we need to jump out of the while loop when we have 1 element. The condition of 1 element is i = j, so we choose our while condition: while (l < r)

# At the end, we need to check the last element: nums[l/r] which has not been checked in binary search loop with target to determine the index. We call it the post processing.

# Summary
# Actually I always do my analysis start from 2 elements instead of 3 elements, because for most of binary search problems, we always can shrink the search space to 2 or 1 element at the end. With 2 elements, it is pretty quick to identify the condition based on your rule.

# Template #1 is the most basic and elementary form of Binary Search. It is the standard Binary Search Template that most high schools or universities use when they first teach students computer science. Template #1 is used to search for an element or condition which can be determined by accessing a single index in the array.

 

# Key Attributes:

# Most basic and elementary form of Binary Search
# Search Condition can be determined without comparing to the element's neighbors (or use specific elements around it)
# No post-processing required because at each step, you are checking to see if the element has been found. If you reach the end, then you know the element is not found
 

# Distinguishing Syntax:

# Initial Condition: left = 0, right = length-1
# Termination: left > right
# Searching Left: right = mid-1
